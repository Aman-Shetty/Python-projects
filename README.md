# Python
**Python** is a _high-level_ language.
Python is *dynamically typed* and *garbage-collected*. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

We can use python to bulid different types of projects and games!
Here are few projects i have built using python.

# GAMES
Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. 

The Games i built using python.  
* Blackjack
* Hangman
* Higher lower
* Rock Paper Scissors
  


## [BlackJack](https://github.com/Aman-Shetty/Python-projects/tree/master/GAMES/BLACKJACK)
***Blackjack*** is a casino banking game. It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as "twenty-one".Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.
![1585940175021_39360a4db2b546a4455230a428a321de.jpg](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/dam/imageserve/1051931270/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200)

Here are the basic rules of blackjack:

**Objective:** The main goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

**Card Values:**
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player's hand the most. For example, an Ace and a 6 can be either 7 or 17.

**Gameplay:**
1. Each player is dealt two cards, usually face up, while the dealer gets one card face up (known as the "upcard") and one card face down (known as the "hole card").
2. Players take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
3. Players can continue to hit as many times as they want until they decide to stand or until their hand exceeds 21, in which case they "bust" and lose the game.
4. Once all players have finished their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card.
5. The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17 points. Some casinos require the dealer to hit on a soft 17 (a hand that includes an Ace valued as 11).
6. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer doesn't bust, the player with a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand wins.
7. In case of a tie between a player and the dealer (a "push"), the player's bet is returned, and no one wins or loses.

**Blackjack (Natural 21):** If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King) as their initial two cards, they have a "blackjack." This is the strongest hand and usually pays out at a higher rate than a standard win, often 3:2.

**Insurance:** Players are offered insurance if the dealer's upcard is an Ace. Insurance is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has a blackjack. Players can choose to take insurance or decline it.

**Splitting:** If a player is dealt two cards of the same rank (e.g., two 7s or two 8s), they can choose to "split" their hand into two separate hands, each with its own bet. The player then continues to play each hand independently.

**Doubling Down:** After receiving their initial two cards, players may have the option to "double down," which means they can double their original bet in exchange for committing to stand after receiving one more card.

## [HANGMAN](https://github.com/Aman-Shetty/Python-projects/tree/master/GAMES/HANGMAN)
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.

## [HIGHER LOWER](https://github.com/Aman-Shetty/Python-projects/tree/master/GAMES/HIGHER%20LOWER%20GAME%20PROJECT)
Higher or lower game is a guesing game. In this game the player guesses whose value is higher.

## [ROCK PAPER SCISSORS](https://github.com/Aman-Shetty/Python-projects/tree/master/GAMES/ROCK%20PAPER%20SCISSORS)
**Rock paper scissors** is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are **"rock"** (a closed fist), **"paper"** (a flat hand), and **"scissors"** (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).  
![image-1.png](https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/hands-playing-rock-paper-scissors-game-flat-design-style-vector-illustration_540284-598.jpg?w=2000)
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied
